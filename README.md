# Adobe Photoshop Lightroom plugin for MOO

## Hello!

If you're a MOO customer who uses Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, you may
find this plugin useful. It allows you to create MiniCards, Business
Cards and Postcards and upload them to MOO, all from within Lightroom.

## Compatibility

The script has been tested with Lightroom 4, although it should also work on LR3.

It has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.6 so far, although it should work on Windows.

## Installation

* Use the ZIP download button near the top of this page (https://github.com/moodev/moo-indesign) to download `moo.lrplugin.zip`
* Unzip `moo.lrplugin.zip` somewhere on your hard disk, which should make a folder called `moo.lrplugin`
* Start Lightroom, and select `File > Plugin Manager...`
* Navigate to the `moo.lrplugin` folder and click `Add plugin`

## Usage

* Select the photos you wish to export 
* Select `File > Export...`
* Select 'MOO' in the dropdown menu
* Choose which product you wish to make from the dropdown (Business Cards, MiniCards or Postcards)
* Choose which orientation you require (Landscape, Portrait or Automatic)
* Click `Export`
* After the photos have been exported, you will be directed to the MOO website, where you can make final adjustments to your cards before adding them to your cart.
